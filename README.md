- 👋 Hi, I’m @GST-00
- 👀 I’m interested in code snippits and approaches to make my everyday engineering work quicker and easier to repeat.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to survive in a COVID world. All my formal coding training was pre-object oriented programming. I've managed to muddle along in Visual Basic, but know I could do much better. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything wherever I find something interesting. The challange of solving the problem and getting a solution is what I enjoy. 
- 📫 How to reach me empirical@hotmail.com.au
